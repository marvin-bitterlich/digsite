a game of digging

if you want to contribute:
--------------------------
- fork this repository
- set up your workspace
 - remember to add all inside /lib as 'external' libraries!
- run http://digsite.de/digsite.exe one time to download all images etc.
- compile your code to an non-executional jar-file named Client.jar (case sensitive)
- place it in %userdir%/.digsite/lib/CLient.jar
- start it throught digsite.exe (there is an internal starter in the package main, not downloading any recources thought!)
